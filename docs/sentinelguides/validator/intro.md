# Sentinel dVPN Validator Setup Guide

This guide is intended for anyone who wishes to contribute to the Sentinel Network by participating in the validation of transactions and blocks.

Validators play a crucial role in maintaining the security and integrity of a network by verifying the authenticity of transactions and enforcing network rules and protocols. To participate in the network, validators are required to stake a certain amount of DVPN tokens. Incentivized by the receipt of DVPN tokens as rewards, validators are motivated to act honestly and ensure the network's security

To operate as a Sentinel dVPN Validator, you need to have a full node.

A Sentinel dVPN Full Node (called also Hub) can be installed on:
- Dedicated server (explained in this guide)
- At home
- Akash Network

To set up a Full Node, you should have a medium level of Linux and networking experience. This guide has been created to assist users in understanding all the necessary steps for installing a Hub and becoming a Validator.

After becoming a Validator, it is also recommended to follow these below sub modules in order to increase its security and offer more decentralization to the network.
- [TMKMS Security](/docs/category/tmkms-security): protect your private validator key!
- [Monitoring Tools](/docs/category/monitoring-tools): make sure everything works properly on your Validator machine!
- [REStake App Setup](/docs/category/restake-app-setup): a guide to join Restake.app and enable your Validator for autocompound
- [RPC Exposure](/docs/category/rpc-exposure): enable remote execution of functions and access to node services
