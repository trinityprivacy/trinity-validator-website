# Sentinel dVPN Validator Setup Guide

This guide is intended for anyone who wishes to contribute to the Sentinel Network by participating in the validation of transactions and blocks.

Validators play a crucial role in maintaining the security and integrity of a network by verifying the authenticity of transactions and enforcing network rules and protocols. To participate in the network, validators are required to stake a certain amount of DVPN coins. Incentivized by the receipt of DVPN coins as rewards, validators are motivated to act honestly and ensure the network's security

To operate as a Sentinel dVPN Validator, you need to set up a full node and create the validator transaction.

A Sentinel dVPN Validator can be deployed on various platforms, including:
- Dedicated server (as explained in this guide)
- Your home setup
- The Akash Network

To set up a Validator successfully, you should possess a moderate level of proficiency in Linux and networking. This guide has been designed to assist users in comprehending all the necessary steps required for setting up a full node and becoming a Validator.

Once you've become a Validator, it is strongly recommended to explore the following sub-modules to enhance both security and contribute to greater network decentralization.
- [TMKMS Security](/docs/category/tmkms-security): protect your private validator key!
- [Monitoring Tools](/docs/sentinelguides/monitoring): make sure everything works properly on your Validator machine!
- [REStake App Setup](/docs/category/restake-app-setup): a guide to join Restake.app and enable your Validator for autocompound
- [RPC Exposure](/docs/category/rpc-exposure): enable remote execution of functions and access to node services

### dVPN node

If running a Sentinel Full Node seems to be unfeasible for you, you can also setup a dVPN node instead and provide bandwidth to the ecosystem. It will still support the Sentinel network and can be a source of income as well. Read more about it in the [dVPN node setup](/docs/sentinelguides/node) section.
